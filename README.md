### Predicting Reddit User Locations

A project where I predict where a reddit user lives in the Americas with their comment activity. The data came from a BigQuery table of 70 million comments made in October 2018. A training set of users with known locations was created by labelling authors who made posts in regional subreddits as living in the Americas or not Americas. With a random forest, the location of 23000 users was correctly labeled with 85% accuracy.

### Titanic Kaggle Kernel
###### [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatthewTourond/Kaggle-Kernel/blob/master/splitting-pclass-and-tuning-models.ipynb) | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mtourond/splitting-pclass-and-tuning-models) 

The Titanic competition is generally the first knowledge competition that new users complete as an introduction to data science. It is a prediction problem with a goal of predicting a binary variable, passenger survival, on the Titanic. This was the first data science related project I completed. 

## **School Projects:**

### Green Food Challenge App
###### [Github](https://github.com/MatthewTourond/GreenFoodChallenge/tree/master/greenfoodchallenge-master) 

An Android app created for a software engineering course, CMPT 276. The goal was to create an app that allowed users to track and share their carbon footprint with some social media functions. The project was completed in a group of 5 members using an Agile development approach. We used git for version control and it was completed with 3 sprints over 6 weeks. Our app won best user interface and we achieved an overall 97% average score over our three iterations. Screenshots of the app can be found in the readme.
