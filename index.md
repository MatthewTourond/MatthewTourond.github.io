# **Personal Projects:**


## Reddit: Text Generator

A project where I try to explore the full data science process from data acquisition to product. I used Google's BigQuery to scrape 40 million rows of user data including usernames, comments, and the subreddit where the comment was posted. Text was generated with a Markov chain using data from particular subreddits. Since comment data is typically a response to a post or another comment, it is more difficult to generate meaningful text.

## Reddit: Data Mining User Information

It's well known that companies routinely collect, analyze, and sell user data. Here I looked in to how much user information can be easily extracted inferred from public information on Reddit.

## Kaggle Kernel: Titanic

The Titanic competitiont is generally the first competition that new users complete as an introduction to data science. It is a prediction problem with a goal of predicting a binary variable, passenger survival, on the Titanic. This was the first data science related project I completed. I wrote a kernel which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mtourond/splitting-pclass-and-tuning-models). 

# **School Projects:**


## Green Food Challenge App

An android app created for a software engineering course. The goal was to create an app that allowed users to track and share their carbon footprint with some social media functions. The project was completed in a group of 5 members using Scrum. We used git for version control and it was completed with 3 sprints over 6 weeks. Our app won best user interface and we achieved an overall 97% average score over our three iterations.
