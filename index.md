# Projects

## Reddit: Text Generator

A project where I try to explore the full data science process. I used Google's BigQuery to scrape 40 million rows of user data including usernames, comments, and the subreddit where the comment was posted. 

## Reddit: Data Mining User Information

It's well known that companies routinely collect, analyze, and sell user data. Here I looked in to how much user information can be extracted inferred from public information on reddit.

## Kaggle Kernel: Titanic

The Titanic dataset is generally the first competition that new users complete as an introduction to data science. I wrote a kernel which can be found here. 

## Green Food Challenge App

A school project done for a software engineering course. The goal was to create an app that allowed users to track and share their carbon footprint with some social media functions. It consisted of three sprints and the requirements can be found here.
