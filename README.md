### Reddit Bot Detector
###### [Github](https://github.com/MatthewTourond/Reddit-Bot-Detector)

There are many useful bots that exist on reddit, but there is no "master" list of bots that exist on the platform. Here, a Reddit bot was created to identify if users are bots by examining utilizing natural language processing. The bot uses several indicators like the median reply time of the user, their comment rate, and most importantly their comment similarity which was measured using cosine similarity. The prediction algorithm was evaluated with the f1 metric. On a test set of 300 users, 20% of which were bots, an f1 score of 97% was achieved.

### Predicting Reddit User Locations
###### [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MatthewTourond/Predicting-Reddit-User-Location/blob/master/PredictingRedditUserLocation.ipynb) | [Github](https://github.com/MatthewTourond/Predicting-Reddit-User-Location/blob/master/PredictingRedditUserLocation.ipynb)

Users in different parts of the world use reddit at different times of the day. Based on a user's pattern activity, their location can be determined with high accuracy. The data came from a BigQuery table of 70 million comments made in October 2018. A training set of users with known locations was created by labelling authors who made posts in regional subreddits as living in the Americas or not Americas. With a random forest, the location of 23000 users was correctly labeled with 85% accuracy. 

### Titanic Kaggle Kernel
###### [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mtourond/splitting-pclass-and-tuning-models) 

The Titanic competition is generally the first knowledge competition that new users complete as an introduction to data science. It is a prediction problem with a goal of predicting a binary variable, passenger survival, on the Titanic. This was the first data science related project I completed. 

## **School Projects:**

### Green Food Challenge App
###### [Github](https://github.com/MatthewTourond/GreenFoodChallenge/tree/master/greenfoodchallenge-master) 

An Android app created for a software engineering course, CMPT 276. The goal was to create an app that allowed users to track and share their carbon footprint with some social media functions. The project was completed in a group of 5 members using an Agile development approach. We used git for version control and it was completed with 3 sprints over 6 weeks. Our app won best user interface and we achieved an overall 97% average score over our three iterations. Screenshots of the app can be found in the readme.
